# SouthMSMetal
A website and forum based around the metal, punk, and hardcore music scene in Mississippi.

I am building this to help myself learn front-end development,
    and because I am a member of said music scene. I believe that
    there are several bands from the area over the last 30-40 years
    that deserve some recognition.

It will start out mainly just as a list of bands from the area, but
    I hope to eventually add a forum for discussion of the music and
    for members of the scene to tell their stories.
